### (Technical) Infosec Core Competencies

###### How to read a CVE announcement and assess the impact based on its CWE / CVSS score and description. Understand that CVSS scores are relative and impact in your environment may be different.

```
CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. CVE is a glossary that classifies vulnerabilities. The glossary analyzes vulnerabilities and then uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to evaluate the threat level of a vulnerability. A CVE score is often used for prioritizing the security of vulnerabilities.
